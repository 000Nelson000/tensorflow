[TensorFlowâ„¢](https://tensorflow.org) is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

## Using TensorFlow with R

The [tensorflow](https://github.com/jjallaire/tensorflow) package provides access to the TensorFlow API from within R. Here's a simple example of making up some data in two dimensions and then fitting a line to it:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(tensorflow)

# Create 100 phony x, y data points, y = x * 0.1 + 0.3
x_data <- runif(100, min=0, max=1)
y_data <- x_data * 0.1 + 0.3

# Try to find values for W and b that compute y_data = W * x_data + b
# (We know that W should be 0.1 and b 0.3, but TensorFlow will
# figure that out for us.)
W <- tf$Variable(tf$random_uniform(shape(1L), -1.0, 1.0))
b <- tf$Variable(tf$zeros(shape(1L)))
y <- W * x_data + b

# Minimize the mean squared errors.
loss <- tf$reduce_mean((y - y_data) ^ 2)
optimizer <- tf$train$GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5)
train <- optimizer$minimize(loss)

# Launch the graph and initialize the variables.
sess = tf$Session()
sess$run(tf$initialize_all_variables())

# Fit the line (Learns best fit is W: 0.1, b: 0.3)
for (step in 1:201) {
  sess$run(train)
  if (step %% 20 == 0)
    cat(step, "-", sess$run(W), sess$run(b), "\n")
}
```

The first part of this code builds the data flow graph.  TensorFlow does not actually run any computation until the session is created and the `run` function is called.

## MNIST Tutorials

To whet your appetite further, we suggest you check out what a classical machine learning problem looks like in TensorFlow.  In the land of neural networks the most "classic" classical problem is the MNIST handwritten digit classification.  We offer two introductions here, one for machine learning newbies, and one for pros. If you've already trained dozens of MNIST models in other software packages, please take the red pill.  If you've never even heard of MNIST, definitely take the blue pill.  If you're somewhere in between, we suggest skimming blue, then red.

If you're already sure you want to learn and install TensorFlow you can skip these and charge ahead.  Don't worry, you'll still get to see MNIST -- we'll also use MNIST as an example in our technical tutorial where we elaborate on TensorFlow features.

## Download and Setup 

You should start by installing the base TensorFlow system. You can do this by following the [installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup) on the TensorFlow website.

Once you've succesfully installed TensorFlow and verified that it's working correctly, you can install the tensorflow R package as follows:

    git clone git@github.com:jjallaire/tensorflow.git || (cd tensorflow && git pull)
    R CMD build tensorflow && R CMD INSTALL tensorflow_0.2.0.tar.gz


The tensorflow package will be built against the default version of python found in the `PATH`. If you want to build against a specific version of python you can define the `TENSORFLOW_PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable before installing. For example:

     export TENSORFLOW_PYTHON_VERSION=3
     R CMD build tensorflow && R CMD INSTALL tensorflow_0.2.0.tar.gz


You can verify that your installation is working correctly by running this simple script:

```{r, results="hide"}
library(tensorflow)
sess = tf$Session()
hello <- tf$constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess$run(hello)
```

## Recommended Next Steps

Once you've installed the base TensorFlow system and the tensorflow R package, you will likely want work though the series of tutorials that cover TensorFlow basics:

* [MNIST For ML Beginners](tutorial_mnist_beginners.html)
* [Deep MNIST for Experts](tutorial_mnist_pros.html)
* [TensorFlow Mechanics 101](tutorial_tensorflow_mechanics.html)

In addition, these articles cover the core concepts of TensorFlow in more depth as well describe some important practical details of using the TensorFlow API from R:

* [Basic Usage](basic_usage.html)
